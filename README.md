### 🗓 Day 25 – Sorting Algorithms & Java Generics Practice  
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**

####  Solved real-world, scenario-based problems using sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort (patient criticality management)
  - Insertion Sort (real-time book arrangement)
  - Merge Sort (sales reports and student ranking)
  - Quick Sort (ticket price optimization)
Analyzed sorting behavior for small vs large datasets, stability, and performance.

####  Created a new branch `java-collections-practice`
- Learned and applied Java Generics best practices:
  - Generic classes, methods, and constructors
  - Bounded type parameters and wildcards
  - Type safety and reusability

####  Topics Learned
- Type safety with generics
- Generic classes, methods, and constructors
- Upper & lower bounded wildcards
- Bounded type parameters
- Avoiding raw types and type erasure pitfalls
- Designing clean and reusable generic APIs
  
#### Implemented real-world generic systems:
  - Smart Warehouse Management
  - Online Marketplace
  - Course Management System
  - Meal Plan Generator
  - AI-Driven Resume Screening System

### 📅 Day 26 – Sorting Scenarios & Java Collections Framework  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)**  
**Branch:** `dsa-practice`

Solved **3 real-world scenario-based sorting problems**:

- **RoboWarehouse** – Shelf loading using **Insertion Sort** (dynamic, streaming inserts)
- **CinemaHouse** – Movie showtime ordering using **Bubble Sort** (small dataset)
- **CropMonitor** – Sensor data ordering using **Quick Sort** (large, unordered data) 

####  Java Collections Framework  
**Branch:** `java-collections-practice`

Learned and practiced the **Java Collections Framework** in depth:

####  Core Topics Covered
- Collection hierarchy: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map`
- Implementations:
  - **List:** ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
  - **Set:** HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
  - **Queue/Deque:** PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque
  - **Map:** HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
- Performance comparison & real-world use cases
- Best practices: generics, choosing correct collection, avoiding legacy misuse

####  Practice Problems Implemented
- **List operations:** reverse, rotate, frequency count, remove duplicates
- **Set operations:** union, intersection, subsets, sorting
- **Queue problems:** reverse queue, triage system, circular buffer
- **Map problems:** word frequency, merge maps, grouping objects
- **Mini systems:**
  - Insurance Policy Management
  - Banking System
  - Voting System
  - Shopping Cart

### 📅 Day 27 – Sorting Algorithms (Scenario-Based Practice)  
**(Date: 17-Jan-2026)**  
**Branch:** `dsa-practice`

Worked on **4 real-world, scenario-based problems** applying core **sorting algorithms** to practical use cases.

####  Sorting Scenarios Implemented

- **IceCreamRush** – Sorted ice cream flavors by weekly sales using **Bubble Sort**  
  *Focus:* small dataset, simple adjacent comparisons

- **SmartLibrary** – Maintained alphabetically sorted borrowed books using **Insertion Sort**  
  *Focus:* dynamic insertion, nearly sorted data

- **ArtExpo** – Managed artist registrations sorted by time using **Insertion Sort**  
  *Focus:* real-time insertion, incremental sorting

- **FleetManager** – Combined vehicle maintenance schedules using **Merge Sort**  
  *Focus:* merging sorted sublists, scalability for large datasets

###  Concepts Covered
- Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
- Choosing algorithms based on data size & nature
- Real-time vs batch sorting
- Efficiency in practical systems
