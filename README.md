### 🗓 Day 2 – Constructors & Access Modifiers  
**(Date: 27-Dec-2025)**Learned core OOP concepts in Java:
- Constructors in Java
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor
  - Copy Constructor
- Constructor Overloading
- Access Modifiers:
  - public, protected, default, private
- Instance vs Class (static) variables and methods

Implemented practice programs:

### 🗓 Day 4 – Object Relationships & Class vs Object  
**(Date: 30-Dec-2025)**  

Learned core concepts of **Object Modeling** and **object communication** in Java.

#### Topics Covered:
- Classes vs Objects (definition, purpose, memory allocation)
- Object relationships:
  - Aggregation
  - Association
  - Composition
- UML basics:
  - Class Diagrams
  - Object Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams

#### Problems Solved: (Examples):
- 📚 **Library and Books (Aggregation)**  
  Library contains multiple books, while books exist independently.

- 🏦 **Bank and Account Holders (Association)**  
  Modeled customer–bank relationships with object communication.

### 🗓 Day 5– Java Inheritance & OOPS Hierarchies
**(Date: 31-Dec-2025)** 

#### 🔹 Java OOPS Practice (`java-oops-practice`)
Learned Inheritance in Java and its role in OOPS.

**Topics Covered:**
- Practiced Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical & Hybrid Inheritance
- Implemented method overriding, super() constructor calls, and polymorphism
- Understood access modifiers and their behavior in inheritance
- Modeled real-world hierarchies (Animal, Employee, Vehicle, Bank, Restaurant)
